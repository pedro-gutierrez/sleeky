# Overview

**Sleeky** is a web development framework written in Elixir designed with productivity in mind.

Being based on the same "Model your feature, derive the rest" philosophy from Ash, applications written with Sleeky are
declarative. Developers can spend more time focusing on their feature, while leaving all the tedious boilerplate to Sleeky.
